# Patreon Video Player
A chrome extension that makes watching videos on Patreon more enjoyable. The biggest drawback to watching videos on Patreon is that they can only be played in a tiny player or in full screen. This chrome extension solves that problem. It allows users to watch videos in a popup window while remaining on Patreon's website. The popup video player can be resized to any size and darkens out the background to make the video the center of attention on screen.
