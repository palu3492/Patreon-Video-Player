# Patreon Video Player
A chrome extension that makes watching videos on Patreon more enjoyable. The biggest drawback to watching videos on Patreon is that they can only be played in a tiny player or in full screen. This chrome extension solves that problem. It allows users to watch videos in a pop-up window while remaining on Patreon's website. The pop-up video player can be resized to any size and darkens out the background to make the video the center of attention on screen. Currently 170+ users.

Download from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/patreon-popup-video-playe/lbafhedneaakdimdfknncbkhlojgjmmh).
